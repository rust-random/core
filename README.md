rand_core
====

Core traits and error types of the [rand] library, plus tools for implementing
RNGs.

This crate is intended for use when implementing the core trait, `RngCore`; it
defines the core traits to be implemented as well as several small functions to
aid in their implementation and types required for error handling.

The main [rand] crate re-exports most items defined in this crate, along with
tools to convert the integer samples generated by `RngCore` to many different
applications (including sampling from restricted ranges, conversion to floating
point, list permutations and secure initialisation of RNGs). Most users should
prefer to use the main [rand] crate.
